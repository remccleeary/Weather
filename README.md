# Weather
A simple weather program in Scala.

## Description
This program uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://www.openweathermap.org) to get the current tempurature. 

## How to Use

In order to use this application you need to have [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) and [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed. 
It also requires a API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

In the [application.conf](./src/main/resources/application.conf) file located at /src/main/resources add your api key here
```conf
api-keys {
    openWeatherAppAPI="<YourOpenWeatherMapApiKeyGoesHere>"
}
```
You may also change the units the degrees are displayed in by changing the settings in this conf file, "imperial"->Fahrenheit, "metric"->Celsius, any other input will default to Kelvin.

```conf
settings {
   unit = "imperial"
}
```

After you have configured your .conf file you may compile and run the project assuming you have installed sbt and Scala. To do this simply run the following commands in your terminal:

```
sbt compile
sbt run
```


You will be prompted with the following:
```
Where are you?
```
at which point you will enter your location like you would into a search engine.

```
Where are you? Chicago IL
```

The program will then reply back with the longitude and latitude that it found based off of your query, 
as well as the name that is stored for that location on [OpenWeatherMap](https://www.openweathermap.org) with the current tempurature for that location.
The name may not be exactly as you but should give you a location close to your original query.

```
Where are you? Chicago IL
Current tempurature for Chicago at latitude=41.850033 longitude=-87.650052:
41 degrees Fahrenheit
```
